## Project: Pizza Sales Analysis

The Pizza Sales project analyzes a pizza store’s sales data using SQL.  
The focus of this project is on extracting business insights such as revenue, order trends, and performance rankings.

### Key Concepts Used

- Aggregations (SUM, COUNT, AVG)
- Revenue calculation
- Ranking using window functions (RANK, DENSE_RANK)
- GROUP BY and ORDER BY
- Subqueries

### Analysis Performed
- Total revenue generated from pizza sales
- Revenue contribution by pizza category and size
- Top-selling and lowest-selling pizzas
- Ranking pizzas based on revenue and quantity sold
- Understanding relationships between orders, customers, and products using joins
